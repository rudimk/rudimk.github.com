          <h4>Hello. I'm Rudraksh. Rudi. Whatever floats your boat.</h4>
          <p>I'm into a lot of things. Code, math, history, art, literature, linguistics and music. I like to think I'm working towards being on the intersection of these fields. Of course, I'm still getting there.</p>

          <p>Feel like contacting me? My email's in the footer below. You can also check out the menu above, with links to me on Twitter, Medium & Github.</p>

        <p>I've been a part of some very interesting startups, like Seat 14A, Mayhem & Madness, and MathHarbor, as well as initiatives like Hacks/Hackers and collectives like HasGeek.</p> <p>I've also had a hand in several other startups, but that doesn't count for much today, does it?.</p>

        <p>I'm also working on some projects that try and spin code and music and visualizations together, as well as better story-telling for the mobile age.</p> <p>And I'm working on some serious historical fiction writing, which has been stuck for years, but might come to fruition someday.</p>
