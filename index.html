<p>I'm into a lot of things. Code, math, history, art, literature, linguistics and music. I like to think I'm working towards being on the intersection of these fields. Of course, I'm still getting there.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've been a part of some very interesting startups, like Seat 14A, Mayhem &amp; Madness, and MathHarbor, as well as initiatives like Hacks/Hackers and collectives like HasGeek. Until February 2016, I was the resident evangelist at <a href="https://wingify.com">Wingify</a> where I set up and maintained a community initiative for product makers and builders in India called <a href="http://notcrud.com">notCRUD</a>. I've also had a hand in several other startups, but that was a while ago :)</p>

<p>These days, I'm the geek mind behind <a href="http://dartboardiq.com">Dartboard</a>, a BI pipeline and consultative service for startups and mid-market businesses. We help build intelligent businesses that are data-aware, data-enabled and data-driven. I handle Dartboard's data pipeline and backend microservices, as well as devops. And maybe a bit of marketing/sales here and there.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get my hands dirty with some projects that try and spin code and music and visualizations together, as well as better historical story-telling for the mobile age. I'm also working on some papers around Marxism and its offshoots, as well as Eastern European history during the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.</p>
