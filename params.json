  "body": "### I'm Rudraksh. Rudi. Whatever.\r\n\r\nI'm into a lot of things. Code, math, history, art, literature, linguistics and music. I like to think I'm working towards being on the intersection of these fields. Of course, I'm still getting there.\r\n\r\n***\r\nI've been a part of some very interesting startups, like Seat 14A, Mayhem & Madness, and MathHarbor, as well as initiatives like Hacks/Hackers and collectives like HasGeek. Until February 2016, I was the resident evangelist at [Wingify](https://wingify.com) where I set up and maintained a community initiative for product makers and builders in India called [notCRUD](http://notcrud.com). I've also had a hand in several other startups, but that was a while ago :)\r\n\r\nThese days, I'm the geek mind behind [Dartboard](http://dartboardiq.com), a BI pipeline and consultative service for startups and mid-market businesses. We help build intelligent businesses that are data-aware, data-enabled and data-driven. I handle Dartboard's data pipeline and backend microservices, as well as devops. And maybe a bit of marketing/sales here and there.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get my hands dirty with some projects that try and spin code and music and visualizations together, as well as better historical story-telling for the mobile age. I'm also working on some papers around Marxism and its offshoots, as well as Eastern European history during the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFeel like contacting me? You can email me at rudraksh.mk@gmail.com. Or you can tweet out to [@vectormein](https://twitter.com/vectormein). You can also read what I write(when I get to write) on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@rudimk) and you can check out what I'm working on these days, on my [Github profile](https://github.com/rudimk).\r\n\r\n",
