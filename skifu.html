  I also happen to consult for startups, on technology. I've always felt that technology is one area where a lot of startups
  actually are unable to find great advice or a friendly word, as they could if it were sales or marketing, the like. Sometimes, 
  you just need to pick someone's brains, or get some code spun up real quick, by someone who knows what he's doing.<p></p>
  
  Well. That could be me! I specialize in web app engineering as well as cloud infrasutructure management. I've had a fair bit
  of experience with mobile apps and mobile backends, although I prefer hybrid approaches using newer tech. I also am a bit of
  a mathematician and data scientist, which means I can help you make sense of your data. Couple that with over 4 years of
  experience working across different companies and startups on their tech, and you have a win on your hands.<p></p>
  
  I'm quite at home with Python, Ruby and Javascript. I've worked extensively on Flask, Rails and Express. I love Postgres, but 
  MongoDB and RethinkDB are my favorites too. To that, add computational math and statistics using Python, R or Julia. However, if 
  you work on, say Haskell, then I'd love to give it a shot.<p></p>
